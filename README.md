# Decentralized-File-Storage-using-Blockchain-and-IPFS
The purpose of storing and exchanging data and centralized storage systems has been widely embraced by 
several businesses, organizations, and people in recent years. However, these solutions raise issues for users 
regarding a single point of failure and the participation of a centralized organization or third party (server). 
Every system aims to achieve key principles of security i.e., availability, integrity, and confidentiality (CIA). 
Smart contracts are secure platforms to store data more efficiently through the process of decentralization; 
to enhance the security of data decentralized storage is used along with Blockchain. Blockchain uses the 
hashing mechanism which further helps to protect the file from being tempered or deleted. But storing files 
on Blockchain is very expensive both in terms of time and money. So, the solution to this is a combination 
of an Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum blockchain to store usersâ€™ data in a distributed manner. 
Distributed user data storage is one of the benefits of the IPFS network. In addition, the document that the 
user must upload is encrypted using SHA 256. For the benefit of all users using our system, the hash that the 
IPFS network returned will be kept in the Ethereum blockchain network. Storage system using IPFS, SHA256 for 
encryption, and blockchain technologies together to ensure decentralized, secure, and transparent characteristics 
for storing and sharing data.
